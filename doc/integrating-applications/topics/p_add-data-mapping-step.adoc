= Add a data mapping step

Almost all integrations require data mapping. A data mapper step 
maps data fields from the previous
connection(s) and any other steps to data fields that the 
next connection in the integration 
can operate on. For example,
suppose the integration data contains a `Name` field and the next
connection in the integration has a `CustomerName` field. You need to
map the source `Name` field to the target `CustomerName` field.

.Prerequisite

You are creating a new integration or editing
an integration.

. On the *Choose a Step* page, click *Data Mapper* to display source
and target fields.
