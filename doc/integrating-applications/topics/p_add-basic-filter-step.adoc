= Add a basic filter step

You can add a step to an integration to filter the data that the
integration operates on. In a filter step, {prodname} inspects the
data and continues the integration only if the content meets
criteria that you define. For example, in an integration that
obtains data from Twitter, you can specify that you want to
continue the integration by operating only on tweets that contain "Red Hat".

.Prerequisites
* The integration contains all connections that it needs to. 
* You are creating or editing an integration. 

.Procedure

. In the left panel, where you want to add a filter step to
the integration, hover over the
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign']
and in the popup that appears, click *Add a Step*.

. On the *Add a Step* page, click *Basic Filter*.

. On the *Configure Basic Filter Step* page, in
the *Continue only if incoming data match* field, select one of the
following options:
+
* Accept the
default that all defined rules must be satisfied.
*  Indicate that only
one rule must be satisfied by selecting *ANY of the following*.

. Define the filter rule:

.. *For this field*: In the field on the left, enter the name of the field that contains the
content you want the filter to evaluate. For example, suppose the data
coming in to the step consists of tweets that mention your Twitter handle.
You want to continue the integration only when the tweet contains
certain content. The tweet is in a field named `text` so you enter or
select `text` as the value in the first field.
+
You can define the field value in the following ways:
+
*** Start typing. The data name field has a typeahead feature that
provides a list of possible completions for you in a pop-up box.
Select the correct one from the box.
*** Click in the *text* field. A dropdown box appears with a list of
available fields. Select the field of interest from the list.

.. *This condition must be satisfied*: In the middle field, select a condition from the dropdown box.
The setting defaults to *Contains*. For the integration to continue,
the condition that you select in this field must be
true for the value that you enter in the third field.

.. *For this value*: In the third field, enter a value to filter on. For example,
if you want to operate on mentions of a certain product from the
Twitter feed, you would enter the product name here.

. Optionally, click *+ Add another rule* and define another rule.
+
You can delete a rule by clicking the trash can icon next to the entry.

. When the filter step is complete, click *Done* to add it to the integration.
