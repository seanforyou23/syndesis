= About adding steps between connections

After you add connections to an integration, you can optionally add
steps between connections. Each step operates on data obtained from the
previous connection(s) and any other previous steps and makes the resulting data
available to the next step in the integration.

Often, you must map data fields that are received from a
connection to data fields that the next connection in the integration
can operate on. After you add all connections to your integration,
check the integration visualization panel
on the left. For each connection that requires data mapping before
it can operate on the input data,
{prodname} displays
image:images/DataTypeMismatchWarning.png[title="a warning"]. Click this
icon to see *Data Type Mismatch: Add a data
mapping step before this connection to resolve the difference.*

Click the link in the message to display the *Configure Mapper*
page in which you add and specify a data mapping step.
