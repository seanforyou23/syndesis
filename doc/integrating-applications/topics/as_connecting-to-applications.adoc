= About connections to applications that you want to integrate
:context: connections

To connect to applications that you want to integrate, the main steps are:

. Create a connection to each application or service that you want to integrate.
. Create an integration that has a connection to each application 
that you want to integrate.

The procedure for
creating a connection varies for each application or service. The details
for creating each kind of connection and configuring it for a particular
integration are in 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}[{NameOfFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}].

The following topics
provide general information about connections:
