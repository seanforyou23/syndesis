= Add an advanced filter step

In a filter step, {prodname} inspects the
data and continues the integration only if the content meets
criteria that you define.
If the basic filter step does not let you
define the exact filter you need, then add an advanced filter step.

.Prerequisites
* The integration contains all connections that it needs to. 
* You are creating or editing an integration. 

.Procedure

. In the left panel, where you want to add an advanced filter step to
the integration, hover over the
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign']
and in the popup that appears, click *Add a Step*.

. Select *Advanced Filter*.

. In the edit box, use the
http://camel.apache.org/simple.html[Camel Simple Expression] language
to specify a filter
expression. For example, the following expression evaluates to true
when the message header's `type` field is set to `widget`:
+
----
${in.header.type} == 'widget' 
----
+
In the following example, the expression evaluates to true when the
body of the message contains a `title` field:
+
----
${in.body.title} 
----

. Click *Done* to add the advanced filter step to the integration.
