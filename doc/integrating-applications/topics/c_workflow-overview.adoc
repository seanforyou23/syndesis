= General workflow for creating an integration

After you log in to the {prodname} console, you can start creating
connections to the applications that you want to integrate. For each 
application that you want to integrate and that uses the
OAuth protocol, register {prodname} as a client of that application.
Applications that you must register with include: 

* Dropbox
* Gmail
* Google Calendar
* Salesforce
* SAP Concur
* Twitter

With registration in place for those applications, the workflow for
creating an integration looks like this:
