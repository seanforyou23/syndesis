= Map integration data to fields for the next connection
:context: map

In most integrations, you need to map data fields that have already 
been obtained or processed to data fields that the next connection in the
integration can process.
{prodname} provides a data mapper to help you do this. In an integration,
at each point where you need to map data fields, add a data mapper step.
Details for mapping data fields are in the following topics:

* <<identify-where-data-mapping-is-needed_{context}>>
* <<find-the-field-you-want-to-map_{context}>>
* <<map-one-source-field-to-one-target-field_{context}>>
* <<example-missing-unwanted-data_{context}>>
* <<combine-multiple-source-fields-into-one-target-field_{context}>>
* <<separate-one-source-field-into-multiple-target-fields_{context}>>
* <<transform-target-data_{context}>>
* <<view-mappings-in-a-step_{context}>>
* <<available-transformations_{context}>>
