The best way to understand the workflow for using {prodname} is to 
create the sample integrations by following the instructions in the

already done that, you can skip this section. 

The following diagram shows the workflow for creating the sample
Salesforce to Database integration.

After you publish an integration, the {prodname} dashboard
displays *Running* next to the integration name when the integration
is ready to be executed.
