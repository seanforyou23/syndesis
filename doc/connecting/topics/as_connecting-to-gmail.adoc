= Connect to Gmail
:context: gmail

To trigger execution of an integration when a particular Gmail
account receives an email, add a Gmail connection to an integration as its
start connection. In an integration, to send an email from a
particular Gmail account, add a Gmail connection as the integration's
finish connection, or as a middle connection. 

The general steps for connecting to Gmail in an integration are:

. Register {prodname} as a Google client application.
. Create a Gmail connection. When you do this you choose the Gmail account that
the connection is authorized to access.
. If your integration sends an email from a Gmail account, 
decide how to populate an email to send.
. Add a Gmail connection to an integration.
. For a Gmail connection that sends an email, optionally map integration
data to the email fields.
