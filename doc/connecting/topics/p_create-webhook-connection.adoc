= Use the Webhook connection 

{prodname} provides a Webhook connection that you can use in 
any number of integrations as the start connection. Each time you 
add this Webhook connection to an integration, {prodname} provides a new 
random token for use with that integration. You paste this token at the 
end of your `GET` or `POST` request. You do not need to create  
a Webhook connection unless you inadverdently delete the provided
Webhook connection. 

.Prerequisite
You inadvertently deleted the Webhook connection that was provided with
{prodname}.

.Procedure: 

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections* to
display any available connections.
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display
connectors.  
. Click the *Webhook* connector.
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections.
For example, you might enter `Webhook 1`.
. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection. For example,
enter `*Sample Webhook connection.*`
. In the upper right, click *Create* to see that the connection you 
created is now available. If you
entered the example name, you would 
see that *Webhook 1* appears as a connection that you can 
choose to add to an integration.
