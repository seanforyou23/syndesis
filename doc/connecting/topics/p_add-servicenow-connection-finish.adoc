= Copy records to ServiceNow during or to finish an integration

In the middle of an integration, or to finish an integration, 
you can copy records to 
ServiceNow. To do this, add a ServiceNow connection to an integration
as the finish connection or as a middle connection. 

.Prerequisites

* You are creating or editing an integration. 
* The integration has a start connection.
* You know the name of the ServiceNow import set that you want to 
add records to. Your ServiceNow administrator can
help you identify the appropriate import set. 
* The ServiceNow import set must have been configured to handle the addition 
of records.

.Procedure

. Do one of the following:
+
* To finish the integration by copying records to ServiceNow, 
on the *Choose a Finish Connection* page, click the ServiceNow connection that
you want to use to finish the integration. 
* To copy records to ServiceNow in the middle of an integration,
after the integration has a start connection and a finish connection, 
in the integration visualization panel on the left, hover over the plus sign
that is in the location where you want to copy records to ServiceNow. 
Click *Add a connection*, and click the ServiceNow connection that you
want to add to the integration. 

. Click the *Create Record* action. 
. Click in *The Import Set name* field and select the import set that
you want to add records to. 
. Click *Next*. 

.Results
* {prodname} adds the connection to the integration. 
* If a data mapper step is needed before this connection, then 
in the integration visualization panel, 
{prodname} displays 
image:shared/images/WarningIcon.png[Data Type Mismatch] on the
connection.
