= Start an integration by obtaining records from ServiceNow

To start an integration by obtaining records from ServiceNow,
add a ServiceNow connection to an integration as the start connection.

.Prerequisites
* You created a ServiceNow connection. 
* You must know the name of the table that you want to retrieve
records from. 
* You should have already defined a ServiceNow query that obtains
only the records that you want.
You can find information about ServiceNow queries here:
https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-platform-user-interface/page/use/using-lists/concept/c_EncodedQueryStrings.html[ServiceNow encoded queries]. 


.Procedure

. In the {prodname} panel on the left, click *Integrations*.
. Click *Create Integration*.
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click the ServiceNow connection that
you want to use to start the integration.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Retrieve Record* to
obtain records from a ServiceNow table that you select. 
. Configure the *Retrieve Record* action: 

.. Click in *The table name* field and select the table that you want
to obtain records from. 
.. In *The query used to filter the result set* field, enter a ServiceNow
query. For example, consider the `state=1^impact=2` query on a table
that keeps records about incidents. This query returns records for  new
incidents (`state=1`) that have a medium impact (`impact=2`). 
If you do not enter a query and the records in the table do not change,  
then the connection obtains the same records every time. 
.. In the *Limit of elements per page* field, enter the maximum number of
records that you want the connection to obtain.  In this release, 
you must enter a value, the recommendation is to enter `1000` or less, 
and pagination is not supported. 
.. In the *Period* field, indicate how often you want to obtain records.
The default is every minute. In other words, by default, {prodname} executes this
integration every 60 seconds. 
.. Click *Done*. 

.Results

* {prodname} generates a JSON schema that defines the structure of the
obtained records. This enables you to add a data mapping step before the next
connection in the integration if data mapping is needed. 
* {prodname} prompts you to choose a finish connection.
