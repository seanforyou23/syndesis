[id='create-timer-connection_{context}']
= Create a replacement timer connection

{prodname} provides a timer connection; you do not need to create one.
However, if you inadvertently delete the provided timer connection
then you can use the *Timer* connector to create a timer connection. 

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections*.
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection*. 
. Click the *Timer* connector. 
. In the *Add Connection Details* page, enter a name for the
connection, for example, *Timer*.
. Optionally, enter a description that distinguishes this connection.
. In the upper right, click *Create*. {prodname} displays a list
of available connections and you can see the timer connection that
you just created.
