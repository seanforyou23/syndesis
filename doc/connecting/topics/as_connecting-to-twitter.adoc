= Connect to Twitter
:context: twitter

To connect to Twitter in an integration, the main steps are: 

* <<register-with-twitter_{context}>>
* <<create-twitter-connection_{context}>>
* <<adding-twitter-connections_{context}>>

You need a Twitter developer account to authorize access from your
{prodname} environment to Twitter. If you do not already have a Twitter
developer account, 
go to https://apps.twitter.com, sign in to Twitter, and click 
*Apply for a developer account*. Obtaining the developer account is 
quick when you provide a professional email address, 
such as `me@redhat.com` rather than a personal address such as `you@gmail.com`.
