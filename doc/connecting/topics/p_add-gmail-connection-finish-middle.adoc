= Send an email from a Gmail account

In an integration, you can send an email from a Gmail account either
in the middle of the integration or to finish the integration.  
To do this, add a Gmail connection to the middle of an integration or as the 
integration's finish connection. 

.Prerequisites

* You created a Gmail connection. 
* You are familiar with the
link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}#alternative-for-populating-email-to-send_gmail[alternatives for populating an email to send]
and you have a plan for populating such emails. 
 
.Procedure

. Start creating the integration.
. Add and configure the start connection.
. On the *Choose a Finish Connection* page, do one of the following:
+
* To finish an integration by sending an email from a Gmail
account, click the Gmail connection that is authorized to access
the Gmail account that you want to send the email from. 
* To send an email in the middle of an integration:
+
.. Click the connection that you want to use to finish the integration. 
.. Configure that connection. 
.. When the finish connection is part of the integration, in the left panel, 
hover over the plus sign where you want to add a Gmail connection and click
*Add a connection*. 
.. Click the Gmail connection that you want to use
to send an email in the middle of an integration. 

. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Send Email*. 
. On the *Configure Send Email* page, do one of the following:
+
* Leave all fields blank if you plan to add a data mapper step
just before this connection and you plan to map integration data 
to the *Send Email* fields.

* Enter information in one or more fields:

.. In the *Email To* field, enter one email address or a comma separated 
list of email addresses to send the email to.
.. In the *Email Subject* field, enter text that states the subject of
the email.
.. In the *Email Text* field, enter the message that you want to send.
.. In the *Email cc* field, enter a comma separated list of email addresses
to which you want to send copies of the email.
.. In the *Email bcc* field, enter a comma separated list of email addresses
to which you want to send blind copies of the email.

* Leave some fields blank and enter information in some fields. 
+
If you plan to add a data mapper step just before this Gmail connection,
and you want to map integration data to some email fields, leave those fields
blank in the action configuration. Enter values in other action fields as needed. 
+
A value that you specify in a *Send Email* action configuration field
has precedence over a value that is mapped from a previous step. 

. Click *Done* to add the connection to the integration. 

.Result and next steps

The connection appears in the integration flow 
in the location where you added it. If you plan to add a data mapper step
before this connection, first add any other connections that you plan to add
to this integration. Then add the data mapper step.
