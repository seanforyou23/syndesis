= Comparison of log steps and log connections

To log information about the messages that an integration processes, 
you can add one or more log steps to an integration and/or you can
add one or more log connections to an integration. 

A log connection cannot be an integration’s start connection. 
Typically, a log connection is most useful as an integration’s 
finish connection. 

The following
table indicates whether a log step or a log connection 
can do what you want.
