= {prodname} Sample Integration Tutorials
:context: tutorials

{prodname} lets you obtain data from an
application or service, operate on that data if you need to, and then send the
data to a completely different application or service. You can do all this
without writing code.

Explore {prodname} by creating these
sample integrations:

* <<twitter-to-salesforce_{context}>>
* <<salesforce-to-db_{context}>>
* <<amq-to-rest-api_{context}>>

See this <<comparison-of-sample-integrations_{context},comparison table>>
to decide which integration to create first.
