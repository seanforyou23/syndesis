= Give the integration a name and deploy it

The AMQ to REST API sample integration is complete when it has a Red Hat AMQ start
connection, a Damage Reporter step, a data mapper step, and it finishes
with a Todo App Client API connection. Follow the instructions here to 
deploy it. 

.Prerequisites
* You added the start and finish connections to the integration.
* You added a Damager Reporter step between the start and finish connections.
* You added a Data Mapper step between the Damage Reporter step and 
the connection to the Todo App API. 

.Procedure
. In {prodname}, in the upper right, click *Publish* to give it a name.
. In the *Integration Name* field, enter a name for the
integration. For example, `*AMQ to REST API Sample Integration*`.
. Optionally, in the *Description* field, enter information that might be
helpful to know about this integration.
. In the upper right corner, click *Publish*.
+
{prodname} displays the integration summary page with a progress
indicator that shows the publishing stages. 
{prodname} is generating the runtime for the integration and
will start it when the runtime is ready. This takes a few minutes.
+
A {prodname} account is limited to a specific number of 
integrations that can be running at one time. For details, 
see the pricing plan. If you are already running the maximum
number of integrations, then you must stop an integration
before you can start running another one. 
+
If you are using a {prodname} evaluation 
account, then only one integration at a time can be running. 
If you already created one of the other sample integrations and that
integration is running then this integration is automatically in the
*Stopped* state. You must stop the running integration and
then you can then publish this integration.  

. If you are already running the maximum number of integrations, follow
these steps to stop an integration:

.. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
.. In the entry for the integration that you want to stop, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right. 
.. In the popup, click *Stop*. 

. After stopping an integration, start another integration as follows:

.. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
.. In the entry for the integration that you want to start, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right. 
.. In the popup, click *Publish*.
