= Give the integration a name and deploy it

When the Twitter to Salesforce sample integration is complete then you
can deploy it and see how it works. 

.Prerequisites
* The integration's start connection is Twitter.
* The integration's finish connection is Salesforce. 
* The integration has a filter step.
* You just added a data mapping step to the integration. 

.Procedure
. In {prodname}, at the top of the left panel, in the *Integration Name* field,
enter a name of your choice that distinguishes this integration
from any other integrations. For
example: `*Twitter to Salesforce Sample Integration*`.
. In the upper right corner, click *Publish*.

+
{prodname} displays the integration summary page with a progress
indicator that shows the publishing stages. 
{prodname} is generating the runtime for the integration and
will start it when the runtime is ready. This takes a few minutes.
+
A {prodname} account is limited to a specific number of 
integrations that can be running at one time. For details, 
see the pricing plan. If you are already running the maximum
number of integrations, then you must stop an integration
before you can start running another one. 
+
If you are using a {prodname} evaluation 
account, then only one integration at a time can be running. 
If you already created one of the other sample integrations and that
integration is running then this integration is automatically in the
*Stopped* state. You must stop the running integration and
then you can then publish this integration.  

. If you are already running the maximum number of integrations, follow
these steps to stop an integration:

.. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
.. In the entry for the integration that you want to stop, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right. 
.. In the popup, click *Stop*. 

. After stopping an integration, start another integration as follows:

.. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
.. In the entry for the integration that you want to start, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right. 
.. In the popup, click *Publish*.
